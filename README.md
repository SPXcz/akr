# About
Steganography is the technique of hiding data in appropriate multimedia carrier, e.g, image, audio or video files. The most common method is by embedding information into digital images. In this metod we hide message into new picture, these changes are unnoticable for the human eye. In this project we are using LSB method for hidding data.
## Last Signigicant Bit
In LSB technique is message hidded inside an image by replacing each pixel's least significant bit with bits of the message to be hidden.
Digital image is represented by pixels. Each pixel contains values depending on its type and depth. The most widely used modes are RGB and RGBA.
RGB modes is represented by 3x8-bit pixels, and for RGBA its 4x8 bit pixels. Each bit has values range from 0-255.
